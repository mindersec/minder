# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The minder community take security seriously! We appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting a vulnerability

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/mindersec/minder/security/advisories/new) tab.

If you are unable to access GitHub you can also email us at security@stacklok.com. 

The [Minder Security Response Team](https://github.com/orgs/stacklok/teams/minder-security-response-team) will acknowledge the report within 24 hours.

Include steps to reproduce the vulnerability, the vulnerable versions, and any additional files to reproduce the vulnerability.

If you are only comfortable sharing under GPG, please start by sending an email requesting a public PGP key to use for encryption.

### Contacting the Minder Security Team

Contact the team by sending email to security@stacklok.com.

## Disclosures

### Private Disclosure Processes

The Minder community asks that all suspected vulnerabilities be handled in accordance with [Responsible Disclosure model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure).

### Public Disclosure Processes

If anyone knows of a publicly disclosed security vulnerability please IMMEDIATELY email security@stacklok.com to inform us about the vulnerability so that we may start the patch, release, and communication process.

If a reporter contacts the us to express intent to make an issue public before a fix is available, we will request if the issue can be handled via a private disclosure process. If the reporter denies the request, we will move swiftly with the fix and release process.

## Patch, Release, and Public Communication

For each vulnerability, the minder security team will coordinate to create the fix and release, and notify the rest of the community.

All of the timelines below are suggestions and assume a Private Disclosure.

- The security team drives the schedule using their best judgment based on severity, development time, and release work.
- If the security team is dealing with a Public Disclosure all timelines become ASAP.
- If the fix relies on another upstream project's disclosure timeline, that will adjust the process as well.
- We will work with the upstream project to fit their timeline and best protect minder users.
- The Security team will give advance notice to the Private Distributors list before the fix is released.

### Fix Team Organization

These steps should be completed within the first 24 hours of Disclosure.

- The  security team will work quickly to identify relevant engineers from the affected projects and packages and being those engineers into the [security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/) thread.
- These selected developers become the "Fix Team" (the fix team is often drawn from the projects MAINTAINERS)

### Fix Development Process

These steps should be completed within the 1-7 days of Disclosure.

- Create a new [security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/) in affected repository by visiting `https://github.com/minder/<project>/security/advisories/new`
- As many details as possible should be entered such as versions affected, CVE (if available yet). As more information is discovered, edit and update the advisory accordingly.
- Use the CVSS calculator to score a severity level.
![CVSS Calculator](/images/calc.png)
- Add collaborators from codeowners team only (outside members can only be added after approval from the  security team)
- The reporter may be added to the issue to assist with review, but **only reporters who have contacted the security team using a private channel**.
- Select 'Request CVE'
![Request CVE](/docs/static/img/cve.png)
- The security team / Fix Team create a private temporary fork
![Security Fork](/docs/static/img/fork.png)
- The Fix team performs all work in a 'security advisory' within its temporary fork
- CI can be checked locally using the [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) project
- All communication happens within the security advisory, it is *not* discussed in slack channels or non private issues.
- The Fix Team will notify the security team that work on the fix branch is completed, this can be done by tagging names in the advisory
- The Fix team and the security team will agree on fix release day
- The recommended release time is 4pm UTC on a non-Friday weekday. This means the announcement will be seen morning Pacific, early evening Europe, and late evening Asia. 

If the CVSS score is under ~4.0
([a low severity score](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document#i5)) or the assessed risk is low the Fix Team can decide to slow the release process down in the face of holidays, developer bandwidth, etc.

Note: CVSS is convenient but imperfect. Ultimately, the security team has discretion on classifying the severity of a vulnerability.

The severity of the bug and related handling decisions must be discussed on in the security advisory, never in public repos.

### Fix Disclosure Process

With the Fix Development underway, the security team needs to come up with an overall communication plan for the wider community. This Disclosure process should begin after the Fix Team has developed a Fix or mitigation so that a realistic timeline can be communicated to users.

**Fix Release Day** (Completed within 1-21 days of Disclosure)

- The Fix Team will approve the related pull requests in the private temporary branch of the security advisory
- The security team will merge the security advisory / temporary fork and its commits into the main branch of the affected repository
![Security Advisory](docs/images/publish.png)
- The security team will ensure all the binaries are built, signed, publicly available, and functional.
- The security team will announce the new releases, the CVE number, severity, and impact, and the location of the binaries to get wide distribution and user action. As much as possible this announcement should be actionable, and include any mitigating steps users can take prior to upgrading to a fixed version. An announcement template is available below. The announcement will be sent to the the following channels:
  - minder-dev@googlegroups.com
- A link to fix will be posted to the [Stackloks Discord Server](https://t.co/3sCyFqDNWA) in the general and minder channels.

## Retrospective

These steps should be completed 1-3 days after the Release Date. The retrospective process [should be blameless](https://landing.google.com/sre/book/chapters/postmortem-culture.html).

- The security team will send a retrospective of the process to the [Stackloks Discord Server](https://t.co/3sCyFqDNWA) including details on everyone involved, the timeline of the process, links to relevant PRs that introduced the issue, if relevant, and any critiques of the response and release process.

## Private Distributors List List

Private Distributors are people who need to be notified of a security issue before it is made public, typically because they are running a service that is affected by the issue. The security team will notify the Private Distributors list before the fix is released. The security team will maintain this list.

* Stacklok, Inc.

### Private Distributors List Membership Criteria

To be eligible for the Private Distributors Membership List, your distribution of minder should:

* Have an actively monitored security email alias for our project.
* Have a user base not limited to your own organization.
* Have a publicly verifiable track record up to present day of fixing security issues.
* Not be a downstream or rebuild of another distribution.
* Be a participant and active contributor in the community.
* Accept the Embargo Policy that is outlined above.
* Be willing to contribute back as outlined above.
* Have someone already on the list vouch for the person requesting membership on behalf of your distribution.
* Are forbidden from sharing embargoed information with anyone outside of the list.

### Removal

If your distribution stops meeting one or more of these criteria after joining the list then you will be unsubscribed.
You share list information with their non-distributor employers within your orgnisation or to anyone outside the
Private Distributors Membership list.
