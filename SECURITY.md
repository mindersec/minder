# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Minder team and community take security seriously! We appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/stacklok/minder/security/advisories/new) tab.

The Minder team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will inform you of the progress toward a fix and public disclosure. Throughout this process, we may ask for additional information or guidance to ensure we have fixed the issue.

Please report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.
