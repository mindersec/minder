# Projects in Minder

Projects in Minder are a way to group entities together. They are a way to organize your entities (repositories, artifacts,
etc.) based on the policy you want to enforce or the team that owns them.

When creating an account, Minder will automatically create a default project for you. You can create additional projects as
a way to organize and secure your entities, and manage access for your team members.
