# Providers in Minder

Providers are integration points from Minder towards external services. They are Minder's way
of fetching information about the different aspects of your supply chain. Taking an operating
system analogy, providers are like device drivers.

Providers are the backbone of Minder. They are the ones that fetch the data that Minder uses to
provide you with insights and analytics. When you enroll a provider, Minder will fetch the data
from the provider and store it in its database.
