# Providers in Minder

A provider connects Minder to your software supply chain. It lets Minder know where to look for your repositories, in 
order to make them available for registration. It also tells Minder how to interact with your supply chain to enable 
features such as alerting and remediation.

The currently supported providers are:
* GitHub

Stay tuned as we add more providers in the future!
