## Prerequisites

- The `minder` CLI application
- A Minder account with
  [at least `editor` permission](../user_management/user_roles.md)
- An enrolled Provider (e.g., GitHub) and registered repositories

## Create the PR vulnerability check rule
Start by creating a rule that checks if a pull request adds a new dependency with known vulnerabilities. If it does,
Minder will review the PR and suggest changes.

Note that Minder is only able to review a PR if it's running under a different
user than the one that created the PR. If the PR is created by the same user,
Minder only provides a comment with the vulnerability information. An alternative
is to use the `commit-status` action instead of `review` where Minder will set
the commit status to `failure` if the PR introduces a new vulnerability which can
then be used to block the PR. This requires an additional step though, where
the repo needs to require the `minder.stacklok.dev/pr-vulncheck` status to
be passing.

This is a reference rule provider by the Minder team.

Fetch all the reference rules by cloning the [minder-rules-and-profiles repository](https://github.com/stacklok/minder-rules-and-profiles).

```
git clone https://github.com/stacklok/minder-rules-and-profiles.git
```

In that directory you can find all the reference rules and profiles.
```
cd minder-rules-and-profiles
```

Create the `pr_vulnerability_check` rule type in Minder:
```
minder ruletype create -f rule-types/github/pr_vulnerability_check.yaml
```

## Create a profile
Next, create a profile that applies the rule to all registered repositories.

Create a new file called `profile.yaml`.
Based on your source code language, paste the following profile definition into the newly created file.

context:
  provider: github
alert: "on"
remediate: "off"
pull_request:
  - type: pr_vulnerability_check
    def:
      action: review
      ecosystem_config:
        - name: pypi
          vulnerability_database_type: osv
          vulnerability_database_endpoint: https://api.osv.dev/v1/query
          package_repository:
            url: https://pypi.org/pypi
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Create the profile in Minder:
```
minder profile create -f profile.yaml
```

Once the profile is created, Minder will monitor any pull requests to the registered repositories. If a pull
request brings in a dependency with a known vulnerability, then Minder will add a review to the pull request and
suggest changes.

Alerts are complementary to the remediation feature. If you have both `alert` and `remediation` enabled for a profile,
Minder will attempt to remediate it first. If the remediation fails, Minder will create an alert. If the remediation
succeeds, Minder will close any previously opened alerts related to that rule.
