# Manage profiles

In order to detect security deviations from repositories or other entities, Minder is relying on the concepts of **Profiles**.
A profile is a definition of a verification we want to do on an entity in a pipeline.
A **profile** is an instance of a profile type and applies to all repositories in a project, with the relevant settings filled in.

An example profile is the following:

```yaml
---
version: v1
type: profile
name: acme-github-profile
context:
  provider: github
repository:
  - type: secret_scanning
    def:
      enabled: true
  - type: branch_protection_require_pull_request_approving_review_count
    params:
      branch: main
    def:
      required_approving_review_count: 2
```

The full example is available in the [examples directory](https://github.com/mindersec/minder-rules-and-profiles).

This profile is checking that secret scanning is enabled for all repositories and that the `main` branch is protected, 
requiring at least two approvals from code owners before landing a pull request.

You'll notice that this profile calls two different rules: `secret_scanning` and `branch_protection_require_pull_request_approving_review_count`.

Rules can be instantiated from rule types, and they are the ones that are actually doing the verification.

A rule type is a definition of a verification we want to do on an entity in a pipeline.

An example rule type is the following:

```yaml
---
version: v1
type: rule-type
name: secret_scanning
context:
  provider: github
description: |
  Verifies that secret scanning is enabled for a given repository.
  Note that this will will not work as expected for private repositories
  unless you have GitHub Advanced Security enabled. If you still want to use
  this rule because you have a mixture of private and public repositories,
  enable the `skip_private_repos` flag.
guidance: |
  Secret scanning is a feature that scans repositories for secrets and alerts
  the repository owner when a secret is found. To enable this feature in GitHub,
  you must enable it in the repository settings.

        package minder

        import future.keywords.if

        default allow := false
        default skip := false

        allow if {
          input.profile.enabled
          input.ingested.security_and_analysis.secret_scanning.status == "enabled"
        }

        allow if {
          not input.profile.enabled
          input.ingested.security_and_analysis.secret_scanning.status == "disabled"
        }

        skip if {
          input.profile.skip_private_repos == true
          input.ingested.private == true
        }

```

The full example is available in the [examples directory](https://github.com/mindersec/minder-rules-and-profiles)

This rule type is checking that secret scanning is enabled for all repositories.

The rule type defines how the upstream GitHub API is to be queried, and how the data is to be evaluated.
It also defines how instances of this rule will be validated against the rule schema.

When a profile is created for an specific group, a continuous monitoring for the related objects start. An object can be a repository,
a branch, a package... depending on the profile definition. When an specific object is not matching what's expected,
a violation is presented via the profile's **status**. When a violation happens, the overall **Profile status** for this specific entity changes,
becoming failed. There is also individual statuses for each rule evaluation. User can check the reason for this violation and take remediation
actions to comply with the profile.

## Prerequisites

- The `minder` CLI application
- [At least one repository is registered for Minder](../getting_started/register_repos.md)

## List rule types

Covered rule types are now:

- branch_protection_require_pull_request_approving_review_count: controls the branch protection approving review count rule on a repo
- secret_scanning: enforces secret scanning for a repo

You can list all profile types registered in Minder:

```bash
minder ruletype list
```

By default, a rule type is providing some recommended default values, so users can create profiles
by using those defaults without having to create a new profile from scratch.

## Create a rule type

Before creating a profile, we need to ensure that all rule types exist in Minder.

A rule type can be created by pointing to a directory (or file) containing the rule type definition:

```bash
minder ruletype create -f ./examples/rules-and-profiles/rule-types/github/secret_scanning.yaml
```

Where the yaml files in the directory `rule-types` may look as the example above.

Once all the relevant rule types are available for our group, we may take them into use
by creating a profile.

## Create a profile

When there is a need to control the specific behaviours for a set of repositories, a profile can be
created, based on the previous profile types.

A profile needs to be associated with a provider, created within a certain project and it will be applied
to all repositories belonging to that project.

For example creating a profile happens by running:

```bash
minder profile create -f ./examples/rules-and-profiles/profiles/github/profile.yaml
```

Where `profile.yaml` may look as the example above.

When a specific setting is not provided, the value of this setting is not compared against the profile.
This specific profile will monitor the `main` branch for all registered repositories, checking that pull
request enforcement is on place, requiring at least 2 code owners approvals before landing.
It will also require that force pushes and deletions are disabled for the `main` branch.

When a profile is created, any repos registered for the same provider and project,
are being reconciled. Each time that there is a change on the repo it causes the related profile status to be updated.

## List profile status

When there is an event that causes a profile violation, the violation is stored in the database, and the
overall status of the profile for this specific repository is changed.
The `profile status` command will inform about:

- profile_type (secret_scanning...)
- status: [success, failure]
- last updated: time when this status was updated

Profile status can be checked using the following commands

```bash
minder profile status list --name github-profile
```

To view all of the rule evaluations, use the following

```bash
minder profile status list --name github-profile --detailed
```
