There are several rule types that can be used to configure GitHub Actions.

## `github_actions_allowed` - Which actions are allowed to be used

This rule allows you to limit the actions that are allowed to run for a
repository. It is recommended to use the `selected` option for allowed actions,
and then select the actions that are allowed to run.

### Entity

- `repository`

### Type

- `github_actions_allowed`

### Rule parameters

- None

### Rule definition options

The `github_actions_allowed` rule supports the following options:

- `allowed_actions (enum)` - Which actions are allowed to be used
  - `all` - Any action or reusable workflow can be used, regardless of who
    authored it or where it is defined.
  - `local_only` - Only actions and reusable workflows that are defined in the
    repository or organization can be used.
  - `selected` - Only the actions and reusable workflows that are explicitly
    listed are allowed. Use the `allowed_selected_actions` `rule_type` to set
    the list of allowed actions.

## `allowed_selected_actions` - Verifies that only allowed actions are used
