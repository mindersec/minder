-- repositories.repo_id was stored as an int32, but it is an int64 from GitHub
-- Note that this takes an exclusive write lock on the table, which should be okay
-- as long as the actual number of repositories is small.
-- Given that we're shrinking the range, we'll need to check that the values are
-- all within range; if not, this migration will fail and need manual intervention.
