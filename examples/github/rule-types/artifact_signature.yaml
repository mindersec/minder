description: Verifies that a given artifact has a valid signature.
guidance: |
  Artifact signing allows a user to add a digital fingerprint to an artifact and verify its trust later.
  It allows the artifact user to verify the source and trust the container image.
  Mediator leverages sigstore(cosign) to verify an artifact has been signed.

  For more information, see
  https://docs.sigstore.dev/signing/signing_with_containers
