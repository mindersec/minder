description: Verifies that pull requests do not add any vulnerable dependecies
guidance: |
  For every pull request submitted to a repository, this rule will check if the pull request
  adds a new dependency with known vulnerabilities. If it does, the rule will fail and the
  pull request will be rejected or commented on.
