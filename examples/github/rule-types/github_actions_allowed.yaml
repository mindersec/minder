  Verifies permissions for github actions for a specific repository.

  Setting up permissions for github actions can be a bit tricky. This rule will
  help you verify that the permissions are set up correctly for a specific repository.
  This rule allows you to limit the actions that are allowed to run for a repository.
  It is recommended to use the `selected` option for allowed actions, and then
  select the actions that are allowed to run.
guidance: |
  Configure your repository to match the organization's profile for allowed actions.
