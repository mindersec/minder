description: Verifies that Dependabot is configured for the repository
guidance: |
  Dependabot enables Automated dependency updates for repositories.
  It is recommended that repositories have some form of automated dependency updates enabled
  to ensure that vulnerabilities are not introduced into the codebase.

  For more information, see
  https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file

  # This will affect the template used to render multiple parts
