description: Verifies that the Trivy action is enabled for the repository and scanning
guidance: |
  Trivy is an open source vulnerability scanner for repositories, containers and other
  artifacts provided by Aqua Security. It is used to scan for vulnerabilities in the
  codebase and dependencies. This rule ensures that the Trivy action is enabled for
  the repository and scanning is performed.

  Set it up by adding the following to your workflow:

  ```yaml
  - name: Trivy Scan
    uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@fbd16365eb88e12433951383f5e99bd901fc618f  # v0.12.0
    with:
      image-ref: ${{ github.repository }}
      format: json
      exit-code: 1
  ```
