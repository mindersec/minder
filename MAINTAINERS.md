## Responsibilities of a Maintainer

As a maintainer, you will have the following responsibilities:

1. **Code Review and Merging**:

   - Review pull requests for quality, correctness, and alignment with the
     project direction.
     - When in doubt, assign pull requests to subject matter experts in the
       relevant subsystem.
   - Merge reviewed pull requests when satisfactory.

1. **Set Technical Direction**:

   - Where appropriate, participate in authoring and reviewing technical design
     documents.
     - Note: many project documents are currently in the Stacklok Google Drive
       instance. We are working to open the relevant documents for community
       review and feedback.

## Maintainers List

The current list of maintainers is:

- @JAORMX (Stacklok)
- @jhrozek (Stacklok)
- @rdimitrov (Stacklok)
- @dmjb (Stacklok)
- @evankanderson (Stacklok)
- @eleftherias (Stacklok)
- @yrobla (Stacklok)
- @lukehinds (Stacklok)
- @blkt (Stacklok)
- @puerco (Stacklok)

Assignment of permissions for these maintainers is currently privately managed
by Stacklok as a matter of circumstance; changes to this list will need a
Stacker to apply some private automation to grant the privileges, until we find
a different approach (for example, donation to a foundation, which would have
their own automation).
