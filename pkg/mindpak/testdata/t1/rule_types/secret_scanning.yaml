version: v1
type: rule-type
name: secret_scanning
context:
  provider: github
description: |
  Verifies that secret scanning is enabled for a given repository.
  Note that this will will not work as expected for private repositories
  unless you have GitHub Advanced Security enabled. If you still want to use
  this rule because you have a mixture of private and public repositories,
  enable the `skip_private_repos` flag.
guidance: |
  Secret scanning is a feature that scans repositories for secrets and alerts
  the repository owner when a secret is found. To enable this feature in GitHub,
  you must enable it in the repository settings.
