### Code of Conduct
This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant](https://github.com/stacklok/mediator/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) code of conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to code-of-conduct@stacklok.dev.

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
If you think you have found a security vulnerability in Mediator please DO NOT disclose it publicly until we’ve had a chance to fix it. Please don’t report security vulnerabilities using GitHub issues, instead, email security@stacklok.com.

### How to Contribute

#### Using GitHub Issues
We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancements. If you have a general usage question please ask in [Mediator's discussion forum](https://github.com/stacklok/mediator/discussions). 

If you are reporting a bug, please help to speed up problem diagnosis by providing as much information as possible. Ideally, that would include a small sample project that reproduces the problem.

#### Sign the Contributor License Agreement
Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/stacklok/mediator). Signing the contributor’s agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an author credit if we do. Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and given the ability to merge pull requests.


#### Pull Request Process
* Create an issue outlining the fix or feature.
* Fork the mediator repository to your own github account and clone it locally.
* Hack on your changes.
* Correctly format your commit messages, see [Commit Messages](#Commit Message Guidelines) below.
* Open a PR by ensuring the title and its description reflect the content of the PR.
* Ensure that CI passes, if it fails, fix the failures.
* Every pull request requires a review from the core Mediator team before merging.
* Once approved, all of your commits will be squashed into a single commit with your PR title.

#### Commit Message Guidelines
We follow the commit formatting recommendations found on [Chris Beams' How to Write a Git Commit Message article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
